# Raw Accel

Raw Accel is a Windows 10 & Windows 11 x86-64 driver which allows for the acceleration of mouse input in the raw input stream. It started as a replacement for [InterAccel](https://github.com/KovaaK/InterAccel) and has been extended with more acceleration types, charts, and other features.
# Download
Download Last Version: [RawAccel v1.6.1](https://github.com/rawaccel/rawaccel/releases/download/v1.6.1/RawAccel_v1.6.1.zip)

## Anti-Cheat Friendly

[Releases](https://github.com/rawaccel/rawaccel/releases/latest) of the Raw Accel driver are signed and run in system space. Raw Accel only modifies mouse input by a constant set of formulas, and adds a one-second delay when changing settings in order to mitigate its abuse.

## Getting Help

For an overview of everything Raw Accel has to offer, please see the [guides](doc/Guide.md). For questions, see the [FAQ](doc/FAQ.md) first.
